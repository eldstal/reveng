The only user account is root.

A file in the "product" partition's "product.zip" contains default account
information: admin:admin

Root filesystem is spread over separate flash partitions, mounted in
/etc/init.d/rcS from the romfs partition:

  /dev/mtdblock6 /mnt/web/
  /dev/mtdblock10 /mnt/pd/      # Product information
  mount /dev/mtdblock11 /mnt/custom/  # i18n Translation strings
  mount /dev/mtdblock7 /usr/          # some lua code, unknown binary /usr/bin/sonia
  mnt_jffs2 /dev/mtdblock9 /mnt/mtd jffs2   # System configuration referenced by Http config. Not present in firmware image. Initialized by /usr/etc/imod
  mount /dev/mtdblock14 /mnt/user/    # SD card? Not present in firmware image.


The same init script also suggests there is a UART console. Kernel arguments set it up at 115200 baud.

/etc/init.d/appauto (which is invoked by inittab) starts either a user-defined application,
a serial getty or telnetd.

/usr/etc/app.sh invokes /usr/bin/sonia and reboots if it ever terminates. This binary contains
colorspace conversion code, so it is at least in charge of image capture. It is possibly also the http daemon.
