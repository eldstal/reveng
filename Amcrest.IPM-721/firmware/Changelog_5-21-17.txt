Important Note: In order for the firmware update to be effective, you will need to restore the default settings on your camera once the firmware update is complete. Restoring your camera to default settings will rewrite all of your settings. If you would like to save your current settings, navigate to Setup > System > Import / Export, and use the Export option to export your camera settings. 

After updating your firmware, navigate to Setup > System > Default Settings, and click the "Restore To Default Settings" button to reset your camera and enable the firmware.

Once the camera is reset, you can then import the settings that you previously exported by navigating to Setup > System > Import / Export and using the "Import" option.
