Video is presented either through RTSP (?) via a broken flash plugin (doesn't attempt to load the actual plugin)
or as a JPEG image (the mobile interface) on http://192.168.52.54/tmpfs/auto.jpg

Device presents HTTP authentication query on all access to the web interface.
Supplying a very long username (~100 characters) forces the device to reboot.
