Video is presented either through RTSP on rtsp://192.168.52.54:554/11 via flash plugin
or as a JPEG image (the mobile interface) on http://192.168.52.54/tmpfs/auto.jpg

Device supports ONVIF 2.0.
A system setting allows the RTSP stream to be authenticated, but is off by default.

Device presents HTTP authentication query on all access to the web interface.
Supplying a very long username (~100 characters) forces the device to reboot.

HTTP server exposes /sd (unused mount point for an SD card) and /tmpfs (contains the JPEG stream and some various status files).
/tmpfs also contains a binary ipc_server (included in this repo as firmware/ipc_server)
