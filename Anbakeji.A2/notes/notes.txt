The device has a unique (?) default password which is the same as its serial number.

Without authentication, anyone can connect using
  rtsp://DEVICE/live0.264
and view the video stream.

There's a telnet server on port 23, giving a login prompt. Other devices using this SoC (Hi3518)
run linux, and that may be the case here as well.

I've found no UART or JTAG on the motherboard.

Net dumps show an amazing amount of outgoing traffic from the camera, connecting to
  http://www.jovetech.com/down/YST/SW/yst_usa.txt
to fetch a server list. The device then connects to all these addresses/ports and sends
mostly static information. Occasionally, a small JSON-formatted payload is sent,
that includes the device's serial number (i.e. the default admin password)
